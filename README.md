# Turbidity Detection of Sample Images using the Principles of Scattering and Image Processing

## Introduction- 

This project intends to give an alternative of expensive and sophisticated conventional Turbidity Meters. In this, I have used the principle of Scattering and Image Processing to 
meausre the Turbidity of a Water Sample. 

Exploiting the fact that whenever light collides with a solid particle, it scatters maximum at 90 degree angle, Image Processing empowers to find the concentration of the solid particles in the water sample, and thus gives the turbidity. 

## How to use the Software? 

1- Clone the repository or download the ZIP file

2- Unzip the file and run Turbidity.m file

3- Select the image sample from the given sampe images

4- Wait for the process to complete. A message box will pop up displaying the Turbidity value.
